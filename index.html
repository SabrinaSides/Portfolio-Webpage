    <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <section>
      <p>It took the isolation of a global pandemic to help me fully understand and appreciate how much technology affects our health, happiness and everyday life. I love that technology can make the world seem so big and give us endless opportunities even from the safety and comfort of our couch. As a Bloc student and future software developer, I am eager to learn and collaborate with others to continue making the world a bigger and better place. </p>
